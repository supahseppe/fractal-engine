Evaluate your most recent deliverable in three steps:

1. Create a rubric (3–6 criteria, each scored 1–5) tailored to this task.  
2. Grade your deliverable with the rubric, explaining each score briefly.  
3. Propose revisions to raise weaker scores.

Format your response as:  
1. Rubric  
2. Self-evaluation (with scores)  
3. Revision Proposal

Do not revise until the proposal has been accepted.
