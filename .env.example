# Copy this file to .env and fill in your values.

# Primary OpenRouter API key (preferred)
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=

# Alternative variable names supported by the dev proxy (use one of these if you prefer)
open_router=
VITE_OPENROUTER_API_KEY=

# Notes:
# - The Vite dev server reads these at startup via loadEnv().
# - The proxy is mounted at /api/openrouter and forwards to OpenRouter.
# - Keep your real keys out of git; .gitignore already ignores .env and this file variant.
