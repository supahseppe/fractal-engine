# 1. Intro Project Analysis and Context

## 1.1. Existing Project Overview

*   **Analysis Source**: IDE-based fresh analysis of the project files.
*   **Current Project State**: The project is the "Snowflake Method Writing Assistant," a web application that guides writers through the initial two steps of the Snowflake Method. It features an AI assistant to help with idea generation and refinement.

## 1.2. Available Documentation Analysis

The following documents have been analyzed to inform this PRD:
*   `SNOWFLAKE_METHOD.md`: Outlines the feature vision for all steps.
*   `memory-bank/app_overview.md`: Provides a technical overview of the current application.
*   `memory-bank/prd.md`: A user-created PRD for the remaining steps.

## 1.3. Enhancement Scope Definition

*   **Enhancement Type**:
    *   [x] New Feature Addition
    *   [x] Major Feature Modification
*   **Enhancement Description**: This enhancement will implement the remaining steps (3-8) of the Snowflake Method, covering character development, synopsis creation, and scene planning. This will complete the core functionality of the application.
*   **Impact Assessment**:
    *   [ ] Minimal Impact
    *   [ ] Moderate Impact
    *   [x] Significant Impact (substantial new code and modifications to existing structures will be required)
    *   [ ] Major Impact (architectural changes required)

## 1.4. Goals and Background Context

*   **Goals**:
    *   Implement all remaining steps of the Snowflake Method (3-8).
    *   Provide AI-powered assistance for each new step.
    *   Create a seamless and intuitive user experience for writers.
    *   Deliver a complete and robust story-planning tool.
*   **Background Context**: The current application is incomplete. This enhancement is necessary to fulfill the project's vision of providing a comprehensive tool for the entire Snowflake Method, solving the problem of writers needing to use multiple tools to plan their stories.
