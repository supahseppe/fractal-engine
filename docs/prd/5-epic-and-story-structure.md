# 5. Epic and Story Structure

## 5.1. Epic Approach

**Epic Structure Decision**: This enhancement will be structured as a **single, comprehensive epic**.

**Rationale**: The work to implement steps 3-8 of the Snowflake Method is highly sequential and interconnected. Each step builds directly on the previous one. Managing this as a single epic will ensure that the development process is holistic, considering the entire user journey from character creation to scene planning. This approach avoids the risk of creating disconnected features and ensures a smooth, integrated final product.
