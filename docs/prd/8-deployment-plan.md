# 8. Deployment Plan

## 8.1. Pre-Deployment Steps

1.  **User Backup Recommendation**: Before the deployment, release notes will be published advising users to use the "Quick Save" feature. This will create a `localStorage` backup of their project, safeguarding their work against any unforeseen issues with the database migration.
2.  **Final Build Verification**: A final production build (`npm run build`) will be created and deployed to a staging environment. A full regression and new feature test will be performed on this build to ensure it is stable.

## 8.2. Deployment Steps

1.  **Deploy Production Build**: The contents of the verified `dist` directory will be deployed to the production static web host, replacing the previous version.
2.  **Production Verification**: After deployment, a smoke test will be performed in the live environment to verify that the application loads and core features are functional.

## 8.3. Rollback Plan

1.  **Rollback Trigger**: A rollback will be triggered if any critical, user-impacting issues are identified in production that were not caught during testing. This includes, but is not limited to, data corruption, failure of the database migration, or critical bugs in the core functionality of any step.
2.  **Rollback Procedure**: The previous stable version of the `dist` directory will be immediately redeployed to the production web host, effectively reverting the application to its pre-update state.
