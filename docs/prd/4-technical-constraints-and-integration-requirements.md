# 4. Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements

## 4.1. Existing Technology Stack

The enhancement will be built using the project's established technology stack:
*   **Languages**: JavaScript (ESM)
*   **Frameworks/Libraries**: Lit (for web components), Vite (build tool)
*   **Database**: Dexie.js (as an IndexedDB wrapper)
*   **Styling**: TailwindCSS
*   **State Management**: Zustand
*   **External Dependencies**: `marked` (for markdown rendering)

## 4.2. Integration Approach

*   **Database Integration Strategy**: New tables for characters, profiles, charts, and scenes will be added to the existing `SnowflakeProject` Dexie database. The database version will be incremented, and a schema migration will be implemented to preserve existing user data.
*   **API Integration Strategy**: All new AI features will use the existing `/api/openrouter` proxy. New prompt-generation logic will be added to `js/api.js` to support the new AI capabilities.
*   **Frontend Integration Strategy**: New features will be implemented as Lit components, placed in the `js/ui/` directory. The main application bootstrap file, `js/app-boot.js`, will be extended to manage the new views and event listeners. The Zustand store in `js/store.js` will be updated to manage the state for the new steps.

## 4.3. Code Organization and Standards

*   **File Structure Approach**: New UI components will reside in `js/ui/`. State management will be centralized in `js/store.js`, and API logic in `js/api.js`.
*   **Naming Conventions**: Existing naming conventions (e.g., kebab-case for filenames, PascalCase for Lit component classes) will be strictly followed.
*   **Coding Standards**: The existing coding style, including the use of ES modules and async/await, will be maintained. New code should be commented where the logic is complex.

## 4.4. Risk Assessment and Mitigation

*   **Technical Risks**:
    *   **Database Migration Failure**: A failure in the Dexie migration could lead to data loss for existing users.
        *   **Mitigation**: Implement a robust migration strategy with thorough testing. Advise users to use the "Quick Save" feature to back up their data before any update.
    *   **State Management Complexity**: The Zustand store could become difficult to manage as more state is added for the new steps.
        *   **Mitigation**: Organize the Zustand store into logical slices for different features to manage complexity and improve maintainability.
*   **Integration Risks**:
    *   **Inconsistent UI**: New UI components could diverge from the existing design, creating a disjointed experience.
        *   **Mitigation**: Create a shared style guide or document of common component patterns to ensure all new UI elements are consistent with the established design system.
