# 9. Post-Deployment

## 9.1. Monitoring and Verification

1.  **Monitoring Metrics**: The primary metric for a successful deployment will be the absence of user-reported bugs related to the new features or regressions in existing functionality. We will monitor community channels (if any) and user feedback for any issue reports.
2.  **Log Verification**: We will perform spot-checks by monitoring the browser's developer console in the live environment to ensure there are no unexpected errors or warnings being logged during application use.

## 9.2. Stakeholder Communication

*   **Communication Plan**: A set of release notes will be published to announce the new features and improvements. This will inform users of the new capabilities and guide them on how to use them.
*   **Key Messages**: The communication will celebrate the completion of the core Snowflake Method workflow, highlighting that the application is now a comprehensive tool for story planning from start to finish.
*   **Channels**: The release notes will be accessible via a link within the application (e.g., a "What's New" modal on first launch after the update) and on the project's website or code repository.
*   **Timeline**: The release notes will be published simultaneously with the deployment.
