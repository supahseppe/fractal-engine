# 7. QA Plan

## 7.1. Testing Strategy

*   **Overall Strategy**: The testing strategy will employ a mix of manual and automated testing. Manual testing will focus on user experience and exploratory testing, while automated tests will cover critical component logic and state management.
*   **Regression Testing Scope**: After the implementation of each new user story, a full manual regression test of all previously existing functionality (Steps 1 and 2) will be performed. This is to ensure that the core features of the application remain stable and bug-free.
*   **Integration Testing Scope**: Integration testing will focus on the data flow between the new UI components, the Zustand store, the Dexie database, and the AI API. Key integration points, such as the AI using data from previous steps, will be a primary focus.
*   **New Feature Testing**: Each new feature will be manually tested against all of its acceptance criteria in a development environment.

## 7.2. Test Cases

Here are some high-level examples of the test cases that will be executed:

*   **TC1: New Feature - Character Creation (Story 1.1)**
    *   Verify that a user can successfully add, edit, and delete a character.
    *   Verify that the AI character suggestion feature returns a list of characters in the correct format.
    *   Verify that all character data is correctly persisted in the Dexie database and reloaded on a page refresh.
*   **TC2: Regression - Step 1 & 2 Functionality**
    *   Verify that a user can still create, edit, and save the one-sentence and one-paragraph summaries.
    *   Verify that the AI suggestion, brainstorm, and refine features for Steps 1 and 2 continue to work as expected.
    *   Verify that no existing data for Steps 1 and 2 is lost or corrupted after the new features are added.
*   **TC3: Integration - Synopsis Generation (Story 1.3)**
    *   Verify that the AI synopsis generation feature correctly pulls and uses the data from the Step 2 summary and the character summaries from Step 3.
    *   Verify that the generated synopsis is correctly displayed in the UI and can be edited by the user.
    *   Verify that the final synopsis is saved correctly to the database and is persistent.
